Areas that are complex
The most intricate parts are likely:

     1. core_tui/session.rs
        Main state transitions, layout, rendering, and interaction coordination.
     2. Transcript rendering and caching
        Reflow, scroll behavior, tool blocks, PTY output, overlays, and cache
        invalidation interact heavily.
     3. Input ownership
        Normal input, popups, approval prompts, search, and fullscreen review each have
        different routing rules.
     4. Async integration
        Terminal events, agent events, PTY events, and redraw requests must be
        coordinated without blocking the runtime.
     5. Theme and contrast behavior
        Theme changes affect normal text, accents, syntax highlighting, status colors,
        overlays, and accessibility requirements.
